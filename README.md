Welcome to my datatableApp project.

Here I've developed a datatable using a dummy API of products .
The datatable is paginated and has some features such as : Order by column (id, title, price) , search product by title, filter by category and filter by range of price.
A part from: create , update , read , and delete products form the list (the last three can be done by clicking the button of "Actions" of each row ;) );

Oh and I added a darkmode / lightmode feature ! 

Tools I've used to develop the project:

Front End framework : React (TypeScript) <br>
Dummy API: https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/products/  <br>
UI: MUI  <br>
State Management: Context API  <br>
E2E Testing : Cypress (also implemented in GitHub Actions) -- npx cypress run  (to test)

*I know it's a small app, but I wanted to develop it based on microfrontend architecture (since it was a requirement in the job offer)   <br>
In case you are interested I also deployed it in AWS: https://d1eyp3tu2ydabm.cloudfront.net/  <br>

<b> **NOTE :  Usually you will see all the products listed correctly , but since I'm using a public API it's probably that sometimes could only appear 1 or 2 products due to other users consuming the API and deleting products, but don't worry cause the Platzi Team (owner of the API)  will restablish it. </b>
<br> ( I'm mentioning this just in case )

Thanks for your attenton!
