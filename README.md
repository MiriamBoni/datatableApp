Welcome to my datatableApp project.

Here I've developed a datatable using a dummy API of products .
The datatable is paginated and has some features such as : Search product by title, filter by category and filter by range of price.
A part from the required features : create , update , read , and delete products form the list (the last three can be done by clicking the button of "Actions" of each row ;) );

Oh and I added a darkmode / lightmode feature ! 

Tools I've used to develop the project:

Front End framework : React (TypeScript)
Dummy API: https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/products/
UI Components: MUI
State Management: Context API
E2E Testing: Cypress
*I knwow it's a small app, but I wanted to develop it based on microfrontend architecture (since it was a requirement in the job offer) 
In case you are interested I also deployed it in AWS: https://d1eyp3tu2ydabm.cloudfront.net/

Thanks for your attenton!
